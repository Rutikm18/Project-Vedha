"""
host_discovery.py — determine which hosts are alive.

METHOD (collection only): for each target we attempt lightweight TCP connects
to a small set of very common ports. ANY response (open OR connection-refused)
proves the host exists, because a refused connection means a host answered with
a RST. Silence on every port = treated as down/filtered.

This is a userland (unprivileged) approach — it does not send raw ICMP. For
ICMP/ARP-based discovery use nmap_wrapper.py, which is more thorough on a LAN.

No exploitation, no payloads — just "is something there".
