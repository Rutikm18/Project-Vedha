"""
pipeline.py — Phase 1 + Phase 2 end to end: JSONL in, Findings out.

  ingest          -> Assets (per-host fact aggregation)
  normalize       -> CPECandidates per Fact (rule-based; AI-assisted fallback
                     on a miss, only when use_ai_assist=True — see Phase 2)
  match           -> raw Findings per candidate, against the pinned snapshot
  dedup           -> collapse same (asset, cve, cpe)
  suppress        -> drop inferred findings a better authoritative source negates
  correlate       -> composite cross-fact findings (SMBv1 + missing hotfix)
  enrich          -> CVSS/EPSS/KEV + priority tier

Deterministic and offline at every step except the explicit, separate
update_snapshot.py sync, and the optional Phase 2 AI-assist fallback (which
itself fails closed to the same deterministic behavior when unavailable —
see ai_normalizer.py's module docstring for the hard rules that keep it
from ever becoming a hard dependency or a CVE source).
