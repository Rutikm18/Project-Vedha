models.py — shared schema for the detection/correlation layer.

Two core objects:
  Asset   — per-host aggregation of every ScanResult fact observed about it.
  Finding — a CVE/CPE match derived from an Asset's facts, with full
            provenance back to the raw observations that justify it.

Neither object ever discards a raw fact — Asset.facts retains every Fact
exactly as ingested (see ingest.py), so any derived field (port lists, CPE
guesses, findings) can always be traced back to source. This is the
"evidence_refs must be resolvable back to raw facts" requirement — it's
enforced structurally here, not by convention: Finding.__post_init__ refuses
to construct a Finding with zero evidence_refs.
